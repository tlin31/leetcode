879. Profitable Schemes - Hard


There are G people in a gang, and a list of various crimes they could commit.

The i-th crime generates a profit[i] and requires group[i] gang members to participate.

If a gang member participates in one crime, that member can't participate in another crime.

Let's call a profitable scheme any subset of these crimes that generates at least P profit, and the 
total number of gang members participating in that subset of crimes is at most G.

How many schemes can be chosen?  

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: G = 5, P = 3, group = [2,2], profit = [2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
To make a profit of at least 3, the gang could either commit crimes 0 and 1, or just crime 1.
In total, there are 2 schemes.


Example 2:

Input: G = 10, P = 5, group = [2,3,5], profit = [6,7,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
To make a profit of at least 5, the gang could commit any crimes, as long as they commit one.
There are 7 possible schemes: (0), (1), (2), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), and (0,1,2).
 

Note:

1 <= G <= 100
0 <= P <= 100
1 <= group[i] <= 100
0 <= profit[i] <= 100
1 <= group.length = profit.length <= 100

Method 1:


Stats:

	- time: O(NPG)

	- 


Method:

	dp[i][j] means the count of schemes with i profit and j members.

	The dp equation is simple here:
		dp[i + p][j + g] += dp[i][j]) 		if i + p < P
		dp[P]    [j + g] += dp[i][j]) 		if i + p >= P


	For each pair (p, g) of (profit, group), I update the count in dp.
	We don't care about the profit of the scheme if it is â‰¥ P, because it surely will be over the
	threshold of profitability required. 
	Similarly, can't have number of people > G

	- cur[p][g], the number of schemes with profitability p and requiring g gang members: except 
	  we'll say (without changing the answer) that all schemes that profit at least P dollars will 
	  instead profit exactly P dollars.

Algorithm

	- Keeping track of cur[p][g] as defined above, let's understand how it changes as we consider 1 
	   extra crime that will profit p0 and require g0 gang members. 
	   We will put the updated counts into cur2.

	- For each possible scheme with profit p1 and group size g1, that scheme plus the extra 
	  crime (p0, g0)  being considered, has a profit of p2 = min(p1 + p0, P), and uses a group size 
	  of g2 = g1 + g0.
