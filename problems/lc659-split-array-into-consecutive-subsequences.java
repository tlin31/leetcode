659. Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences - Medium

Given an array nums sorted in ascending order, return true if and only if you can split it into 1 or 
more subsequences such that each subsequence consists of consecutive integers and has length AT LEAST 3.

 

Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3
3, 4, 5

Example 2:
Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
Output: True
Explanation:
You can split them into two consecutive subsequences : 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
3, 4, 5

Example 3:
Input: [1,2,3,4,4,5]
Output: False
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10000

method 1:

method:
	- Greedy:
		Considering numbers x from left to right, if x can be added to a current chain, it is at least 
		as good to add x to that chain first, rather than to start a new chain.

		Because if we started with numbers x and greater from the beginning, the shorter chains starting 
		from x could be concatenated with the chains ending before x, possibly helping us if there 
		was a "chain" from x that was only length 1 or 2.
	

	- We iterate through the array once to get the frequency of all the elements in the array
	- We iterate through the array once more and for each element we either:
		1. see if it can be appended to a previously constructed consecutive sequence  
		2. if it can be the start of a new consecutive sequence. 
		3. If neither are true, then we return false.

	- eg: [1,2,3,4,5]
		// i =1
		we fall in case 3 "start of a new subsequence"
		we decrease frequence of  2, 3 to 0
		and put <4, 1> in appendfreq, this mean I have 1 subsequence can continue from 4

		//i =2, 3
		we continue

		//i = 4
		we fall in 2 case since <4, 1> is in appendfreq
		now this subsequence should end in 5
		so we decreace <4, 1> to <4, 0> since we no longer have subsequence can continue from 4
		and we put <5, 1> in appendfreq since now we have a subsequence can continue from 5
