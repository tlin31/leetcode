750. Number Of Corner Rectangles - Medium


Given a grid where each entry is only 0 or 1, find the number of corner rectangles.

A corner rectangle is 4 distinct 1s on the grid that form an axis-aligned rectangle. 
Note that only the corners need to have the value 1. Also, all four 1s used must be distinct.

 

Example 1:

Input: grid = 
[[1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
 [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one corner rectangle, with corners grid[1][2], grid[1][4], grid[3][2], grid[3][4].
 

Example 2:

Input: grid = 
[[1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1],
 [1, 1, 1]]
Output: 9
Explanation: There are four 2x2 rectangles, four 2x3 and 3x2 rectangles, and one 3x3 rectangle.
 

Example 3:

Input: grid = 
[[1, 1, 1, 1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Rectangles must have four distinct corners.
 

Note:

The number of rows and columns of grid will each be in the range [1, 200].
Each grid[i][j] will be either 0 or 1.
The number of 1s in the grid will be at most 6000.

Method 1: Count


Stats:

	- Time Complexity: O(R*C^2) where R, C is the number of rows and columns.
	- Space Complexity: O(C^2) in additional space.


Method:

	-  We ask the question: for each additional row, how many more rectangles are added?
	-  For each pair of 1s in the new row (say at new_row[i] and new_row[j]), we could create more
	   rectangles where that pair forms the base. 
	-  The # of new rectangles is the # of times some previous row had row[i] = row[j] = 1.
	-  count[i, j] = # of times we saw row[i] = row[j] = 1. 
	   When we process a new row, for every pair new_row[i] = new_row[j] = 1, we add count[i, j] to 
	   the answer, then we increment count[i, j].

            	// find the pair(c1, c2) which both = 1 to form the base of new rectangle
            	if (row[c1] == 1) {
	                for (int c2 = c1+1; c2 < row.length; c2++) {

	                	if (row[c2] == 1) {
	                		// key of hashmap
		                    int pos = c1 * 200 + c2;
		                    int c = count.getOrDefault(pos, 0);

/**
 * first step: we can keep two horizontal line x1 and x2 unchanged, and use a moving vertical line to scan from 
 * left to right to count number of valid vertical line we can find between x1 and x2 (valid means both of 
 * grid[x1][k] and grid[x2][k] is equal to 1). Because any two valid vertical lines between x1 and x2 can form 
 * a rectangle with connecting two horizontal lines x1 and x2
 * 
 * second step: after counting number of vertical lines between two horizontal lines, we can calculate number of
 * rectangles between x1 and x2. The equation should be equivalent to select 2 from total number of vertical lines
 * i.e.: count * (count - 1) / 2

Stats:

	- complexity of counting a heavy row to O(N), and there are at most sqrt N heavy rows.

When a row is filled with X 1s, we do O(X^2) work to enumerate every pair of 1s. 

ex. entire top row is filled with 1s. When looking at the next row with say, f ä¸ª 1s that match the 
top row, the number of rectangles created is just the number of pairs of 1s, which is f * (f-1) / 2. 
We could find each f quickly using a Set and a simple linear scan of each row.

Let's call a row to be heavy if it has more than sqrt N points. 



class Solution {
    public int countCornerRectangles(int[][] grid) {
        List<List<Integer>> rows = new ArrayList();
        int N = 0;
        for (int r = 0; r < grid.length; ++r) {
            rows.add(new ArrayList());
            for (int c = 0; c < grid[r].length; ++c)
                if (grid[r][c] == 1) {
                    rows.get(r).add(c);
                    N++;
                }
        }

        int sqrtN = (int) Math.sqrt(N);
        int ans = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> count = new HashMap();

        for (int r = 0; r < grid.length; ++r) {
            if (rows.get(r).size() >= sqrtN) {
                Set<Integer> target = new HashSet(rows.get(r));

                for (int r2 = 0; r2 < grid.length; ++r2) {
                    if (r2 <= r && rows.get(r2).size() >= sqrtN)
                        continue;
                    int found = 0;
                    for (int c2: rows.get(r2))
                        if (target.contains(c2))
                            found++;
                    ans += found * (found - 1) / 2;
                }
            } else {
                for (int i1 = 0; i1 < rows.get(r).size(); ++i1) {
                    int c1 = rows.get(r).get(i1);
                    for (int i2 = i1 + 1; i2 < rows.get(r).size(); ++i2) {
                        int c2 = rows.get(r).get(i2);
                        int ct = count.getOrDefault(200*c1 + c2, 0);
                        ans += ct;
                        count.put(200*c1 + c2, ct + 1);
                    }
                }
