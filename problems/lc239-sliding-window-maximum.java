239. Sliding Window Maximum - Hard

Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of 
the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding 
window moves right by one position. Return the max number of these sliding window.

Example:

Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7] 
Explanation: 

Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
Note:
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ input arrays size for non-empty array.

method 1:

method:

	- Deque
	- in a maximum heap, heap[0] is always the largest element. Though to add an element in a heap of 
		size k costs log(k), that means O(n * logk) time complexity 
	- use a deque (double-ended queue), the structure which pops from / pushes to either side with the 
		same O(1) performance.

	- store the deque indexes instead of elements since both are used during an array parsing.

Algorithm:
	- Process the first k elements separately to initiate the deque.
		Iterate over the array, at each step :
    			Clean the deque :
        				1. Keep only the indexes of elements from the current sliding window.
        				2. Remove indexes of all elements smaller than the current one, since they 
        				   will not be the maximum ones.
    			Append the current element to the deque.
    			Append deque[0] to the output.
		Return the output array.

method 3:

https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/Figures/239/one_two.png

	- DP, like stock buy and sell
	- The idea is to split an input array into blocks of k elements. The last block could contain 
		less elements if n % k != 0.
	- The current sliding window with the first element i and the last element j could be placed 
		inside one block, or in two different blocks.
	- situation 1:
		we use an array left, where left[j] is a maximum element from the 
		beginning of the block to index j, direction left->right.
	- situation 2:
		we introduce array right, where right[j] is a maximum element from the end of the 
		block to index j, direction right->left. right is basically the same as left, but in the 
		other direction.
	- These two arrays together give all the information about window elements in both blocks. we 
		consider a sliding window from index i to index j. By definition, element right[i] is a 
		maximum element for window elements in the leftside block, and element left[j] is a maximum 
		element for window elements in the rightside block. 

	- Hence the maximum element in the sliding window is max(right[i], left[j]).


Algorithm:
	1. Iterate along the array in the direction left->right and build an array left.

	2. Iterate along the array in the direction right->left and build an array right.

	3. Build an output array as max(right[i], left[i + k - 1]) for i in range (0, n - k + 1).




stats:

	- time: O(N) since all we do is 3 passes along the array of length N.
	- Space: O(N) to keep left and right arrays of length N, and output array of length N - k + 1.

class Solution {
  public int[] maxSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.length;
    if (n * k == 0) return new int[0];
    if (k == 1) return nums;

    int [] left = new int[n];
    left[0] = nums[0];
    int [] right = new int[n];
    right[n - 1] = nums[n - 1];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      // from left to right
      if (i % k == 0) 
      	left[i] = nums[i];  // block_start
      else 
      	left[i] = Math.max(left[i - 1], nums[i]);

      // from right to left
      int j = n - i - 1;
      if ((j + 1) % k == 0) 
      	right[j] = nums[j];  // block_end
      else 
      	right[j] = Math.max(right[j + 1], nums[j]);
    }

    int [] output = new int[n - k + 1];
    for (int i = 0; i < n - k + 1; i++)
      output[i] = Math.max(left[i + k - 1], right[i]);

    return output;
  }
}


ex. Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3


left = [1, 3, 3, -3, 5, 5, 6, 7]

right = [3, 3, -1, 5, 5, 3, 7, 7]

Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
