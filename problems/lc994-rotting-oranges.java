994. Rotting Oranges - Easy

In a given grid, each cell can have one of three values:

the value 0 representing an empty cell;
the value 1 representing a fresh orange;
the value 2 representing a rotten orange.
Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.  If this 
is impossible, return -1 instead.

 

Example 1:

Input: [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4


Example 2:
Input: [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation:  The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because 
rotting only happens 4-directionally.


Example 3:
Input: [[0,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation:  Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
 

Note:

1 <= grid.length <= 10
1 <= grid[0].length <= 10
grid[i][j] is only 0, 1, or 2.

method 1:

method:
	- time stampï¼Œ use min to record the minutes
	- every minute we update the rotten orage to be min+3 and in the next iteration increase 
	  the min (next min) check for next rotten min+2.

	- when see a rotten, change it to 0 --> we already processed this
	  					 change the cell around it to min +2, because = next rotten

	- when there are still rotten ones, min ++
	- another case, when there is no rotten, and all are fresh, then return -1

method 2:

method:

	- bfs
	- First, we traverse the whole grid to find out the positions of rotten oranges and compute the 
	  total num of orange as well, add the positions of rotten oranges into a queue;

	- Secondly, dequeue to get the position of a rotten orange. Due to the infection, the fresh 
	  oranges near the rotten orange become rotten. So we check the cell in the left/right/top/down 
	  of the rotten orange, if it is a fresh orange, enqueue it. 

	  Continue to dequeue until all rotten oranges of last round are removed from the queue
